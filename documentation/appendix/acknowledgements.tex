\section{Acknowledgments and Special Thanks}

This project would not be possible if not for the following people and
organizations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mr. James Hall} was very patient with us as we knocked
the host machine offline many times before he eventually worked through
setting up external networking with us. In addition he was readily
available by phone and email to help us through any problems we
encountered.
  \item \textbf{Institute for Next Generation IT System} all hardware
for this project was supplied by ITng and without their support we would
not have been able to deliver a final product.
  \item \textbf{Meaghan Johnson} really helped narrow down the project
scope and requirements and provided an excellent guide on configuring
the guest virtual machines.
  \item \textbf{Dr. Michael Kowolenko} described the motivation and goals
of the platform, in addition to providing and overview of data analysis. 
  \item \textbf{Mr. John Streck} without the lessons learned in Mr.
Streck's lectures this project and report would have failed to meet any
expectations.
  \item \textbf{Shireesh Bhat} have fun grading.
\end{itemize}
