\section{Common PackStack Errors and Fixes}
\label{app:errors}

When installing PackStack a few common errors repeatedly occurred. This
section contains the fixes to these errors.

\subsection{Instance Launch Errors}

During instance launch two errors occurred on multiple occasions.

\subsubsection{Host is not mapped to any cell}

There was very little to no documentation on this error but the
following command fixed the problem.

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=&]
sudo nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup
\end{lstlisting}

Running this command usually resulted in a message stating ``cell0
already setup'' but this command removed the Host not mapped to any cell
error.

\subsubsection{No hypervisors Available}

This error is very simple and caused by libvirtd not being properly
started during the RDO OpenStack PackStack install. The following
command brings the hypervisor back online.

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=&]
sudo service libvirtd restart
\end{lstlisting}
