\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

This project is motivated by the goal to create a data analytics cloud
platform with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Flexible Data Analysis, Extendability, and ease of use}

Current open sourced data analytic packages are either too specific to
one data set and not very flexible or they are too generic to
accommodate many data sets and do not operate efficiently by wasting
resources on unneeded packages or software. However, the goal of this
platform is to provide a base for data analytic engines that tailor to a
specific need or data set. Users can then select the specific analysis
engine they need, load it into the analytics platform and get the best
performance by reducing the number of unneeded software and packages.
This base platform will provide generic support for users to define and
create their own data analytic engines and pre-existing data analytic
engines will require minimal configuration in order to operate on a
specific data set.

  \item \textbf{Portability}

Given a base platform, as described in this report, consumers will easily
be able to download an analytics image to their local environment or
configure the base platform in a public cloud and upload images to meet
their computing needs.

  \item \textbf{Robust Structuring of Data} 

This platform has a goal to make discovering and importing unstructured
data into a structured format, which can then be processed by data
analytic packages. The platform should be intuitive, easy with basic configuration and
should expect minimum configuration knowledge by the end user.

\end{enumerate}
