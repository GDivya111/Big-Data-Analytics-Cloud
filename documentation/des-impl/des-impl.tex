\section{Design, Implementation, and Results}
\label{sec:des-impl}

In this section, we first describe the design of the system as a whole,
identifying design decisions and discussing their trade-offs and then
focus on how our design addresses the four major issues raised in
Section~\ref{sec:issues}. 

Following the discussion of the design is the implementation, the
results of the implementation, and finally the section wraps up with
the limitations of our implementation.
