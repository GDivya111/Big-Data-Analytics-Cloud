As the collection of large data sets has increased, the demand for
analysis tools with the ability to operate on them has sky rocketed. 
Unfortunately, many current solutions and data analysis tools do not
meet the needs of data analysts due to their inflexibility to operate on
a wide variety of data sets. To address this problem, we seek to design a
data analytics cloud platform and implement a data analytics engine on
top of our platform. In this report, we detail our design and
implementation processes of the analytics cloud platform and the data
analysis engine, which aid the development of novel and computationally
intensive algorithms that operate on large data sets. The platform we deliver
provides an analysis engine that crawls the web, converts unstructured
data to structured data and combines it with structured data, filters
data, and finally visualizes the data for the user. This engine is built
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and runs in a local OpenStack environment
deployed in the Oscar Lab on North Carolina State University's
Centennial Campus. Our testing shows our system successfully crawls the web,
structures, combines, and filters the data, and visualizes the results in an
intuitive and seamless workflow.
